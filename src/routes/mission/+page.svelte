    <h1>The Mission</h1>
    <p>The ICPFA has been created to bring decentralised internet services to football fans around the world. 
        Our aim is to change the current system of exploiting fans around the world for profit and use the commercial value of their
        engagement to reward them and footballing communities around the world.
    </p>

    <p>The ICPFA Community Fund has been created for football related charitable projects around the world. 
        This fund will be used to make a positive impact to people's lives using football. 
    <p>
        The ICPFA Community Fund will be funded by the ICPFA founder, James Beadle. 
            For each ICPFA project that generates maturity interest or revenue, James will deposit 25% of his share into the ICPFA community fund. 
    </p>

    <p>100% of the revenue from the FootballGod platform will also be added to the ICPFA community fund.</p>
