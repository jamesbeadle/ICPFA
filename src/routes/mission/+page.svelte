        Football is the world's most-watched sport, attracting an estimated 4 billion fans. Beyond the pitch, football acts as a powerful catalyst for social improvement, community development, and providing promising young talent with avenues to success.
    </p>
   
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
        We have created the ICPFA to provide this huge fanbase a range of high quality apps, decentralised internet services and investment opportunities. 
        We feel doing this will attract a large number of new users to the ICP ecosystem. Our first DAO, OpenFPL, is improving on an existing Web2 service with 10m users.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-6 mb-4">ICPFA Community Fund</h2>

    <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
        The ICPFA Community Fund has been created for football related charitable projects around the world. 
        This fund will be used to make a positive impact to people's lives using football. 
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
        The ICPFA Community Fund will be funded by the ICPFA founder, James Beadle. 
        For each ICPFA project that generates maturity interest or revenue, James will deposit 25% of his share into the ICPFA community fund.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mb-4 text-xl">
        100% of the revenue from the FootballGod platform will also be added to the ICPFA community fund.
