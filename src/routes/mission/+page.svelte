                            Football is the world's most-watched sport, attracting an estimated 4 billion fans. 
                            Beyond the pitch, football acts as a powerful catalyst for social improvement, community development, 
                            and providing promising young talent with avenues to success.

                            We have created the ICPFA to provide this huge fanbase a range of high quality apps, decentralised internet services and investment opportunities. 
                            We feel doing this will attract a large number of new users to the ICP ecosystem. Our first DAO, OpenFPL, is improving on an existing Web2 service with 10m users.

                            The ICPFA Community Fund has been created for football related charitable projects around the world.
